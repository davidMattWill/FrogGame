To play the game try the release page. As of right now there are no instructions and the play area is small but its a working demo of what I've been working on. 
You can play with the spacebar and L/R Keys. Hold spacebar to charge a jump and use the L/R keys to control the frog while hes jumping. Try not to hit anything!
